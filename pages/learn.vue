        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a tournament and be the first to check-in to become the VIP. The VIP has
            special admin controls unavailable to the rest of the players.
          </li>
          <li>Share the link and/or QR code with your participants.</li>
          <li>
            When there are at least two participants the VIP can click "Begin Tournament"
            to generate matches. No more participants can be added once the tournament has begun.
          </li>
          <li>When everyone is ready, the VIP can click "Begin Matches" to start the game.</li>
          <li>As each round completes, the VIP will need to click "Begin Matches" again to start the next round.</li>
          <li>Keep going until you have a champion!</li>

        <ul>
          <li>For the vast majority of cases, refreshing the page should resolve any issues.</li>
          <li>A plug icon next to player's name means that they are disconnected. Refreshing should fix it.</li>
          <li>A player can "reclaim" a checked-in name that is disconnected by entering that name again.</li>
          <li>
            The VIP can open the "Danger Zone" menu and click "Reset Tournament" to revert
            the tournament back to an unstarted state.
